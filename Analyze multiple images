The main purpose of this code is to analyse wave propagation in a sequence of TIFF images by extracting the green channel, defining a region of interest (ROI), performing background subtraction, computing the mean intensity across columns, and visualizing the results. The script processes multiple images, combines them into a 2D colour map (pseudo colour plot) to represent intensity variations over time, and plots the mean intensity profile. This is particularly useful for studying optical wave propagation, intensity variations in dynamic systems, and scientific imaging applications.
