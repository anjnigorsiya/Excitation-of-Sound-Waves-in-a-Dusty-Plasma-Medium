The main purpose of this code is to analyse the dispersion relation of Dust Acoustic Waves (DAWs) in a plasma by computing key plasma parameters such as Debye length, plasma frequency, and dust acoustic velocity, and then plotting the wave frequency (Ï‰) as a function of wave number (k). This helps in understanding how dust particles influence wave propagation in a dusty plasma, which is relevant to space physics, astrophysics, and plasma research.
