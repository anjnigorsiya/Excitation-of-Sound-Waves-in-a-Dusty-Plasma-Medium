The main purpose of this code is to analyse the intensity distribution in a specific region of a TIFF image by extracting the green channel, selecting a region of interest (ROI), computing the mean intensity across image columns, and plotting the intensity profile. This helps in studying intensity variations, which can be useful in optical experiments, image analysis, and scientific imaging applications.
